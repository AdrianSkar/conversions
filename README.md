        How can we use GitHub to manage tasks, etc? 
        Should we have sprints? 2-week sprints?

### Tips and tricks:
- Netlify supports [branch preview](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&utm_source=netlify&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=branch-deploys#branches-and-deploys) too so we don't need to push changes into production if we're not sure about them yet or we don't have a working local test environment:
    > Branch deploys are published to a URL which includes the branch name as a prefix. For example, if a branch is called `staging`, it will deploy to `staging--yoursitename.netlify.app`.
